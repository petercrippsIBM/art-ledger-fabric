# Step 2: Install Samples, Binaries and Docker Images
There is currently no installer for Hyperledger Fabric binaries but from the Hyperledger Fabric site you can get a script which will download and install samples and binaries to your local system.

The latest instructions for doing this (i.e. for the current version of Hyperledger Fabric) can be obtained [here](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.2/install.html).

You need to download samples into a new directory. I use a one that indicates the version of Fabric it contains: `fabricv12`. Once you have installed the samples following the above instructions you will end up with a set of files and subdirectories as below.

You will see there are a number of samples that have been downloaded, we'll be using the `first-network` one. Commands in the rest of these instructions must be run from there so change to that directory now e.g. (assuming you created `fabricv12` off your $HOME directory):
```
$ cd $HOME/fabricv12/fabric-samples/first-network
```

A fully annotated script `byfn.sh` that leverages the downloaded Docker images to quickly bootstrap a Hyperledger Fabric network comprised of 4 peers representing two different organizations, and an orderer node is provided. The script will also launch a container to run a scripted execution that will join peers to a channel, deploy and instantiate chaincode and drive execution of transactions against the deployed chaincode. To get help on the commands enter:
```
$ ./byfn.sh -h
```

To generate a first network execute the following command:
```
$ ./byfn.sh generate
```

This first step generates all of the certificates and keys for the various network entities, the genesis block used to bootstrap the ordering service, and a collection of configuration transactions required to configure a channel.

Next, you can bring the network up with one of the following commands:
```
./byfn.sh up
```

The above command will compile Golang chaincode images and spin up the corresponding containers. Go is the default chaincode language, however there is also support for Node.js chaincode. If youâ€™d like to run through this tutorial with node chaincode, pass the following command instead:
```
./byfn.sh up -l node
```

To bring down the network enter the following command:
```
./byfn.sh down
```

To learn more about the underlying tooling and bootstrap mechanics look at the detailed instructions which can be found [here](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.2/build_network.html).
