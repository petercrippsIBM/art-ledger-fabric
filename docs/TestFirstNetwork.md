# Step 3: Test the First Network
Before we install **Art-Ledger** on the first network we installed and brought up (then down) in the previous step its worth checking out this network in more detail using the `fabcar` sample supplied with the first network. If you want to do that follow the instructions [here](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.2/write_first_app.html).

These instructions take you through the steps of:
* Installing the Clients and Launching the Network
* Enrolling the Admin User
* Registering and Enrolling a User
* Querying the Ledger
* Updating the Ledger

If you follow these instructions you should have a pretty good idea of how applications that use the ledger (i.e. execute chaincode against it) work. Next we'll see how to apply these ideas to our previously developed **Art-Ledger** code that was [built using Hyperledger Composer](https://github.com/petercrippsIBM/art-ledger).

Now go to [Step 4: Install and Run Art-Ledger on a Local Fabric Network](../docs/InstallRunLocalFabric.md).
