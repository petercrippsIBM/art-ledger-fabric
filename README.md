# Building Your First Hyperledger Network on IBM Cloud Using Hyperledger Fabric

These instruction follow on from those in this [repository](https://github.com/petercrippsIBM/art-ledger) where I describe how to build the **Art-Ledger** blockchain network using Hyperledger Composer. Here, rather than using Composer, we will work with chaincode written directly in Go and install it ourselves first on a Fabric network which you run on your local machine using Docker then on the IBM Blockchain Platform Starter Plan (for which you will need a subscription).

* [Step 1: Install Prerequisites](docs/InstallPrerequisites.md)
* [Step 2: Install Samples, Binaries and Docker Images](docs/InstallSamples)
* [Step 3: Start and Stop the Fabric Network](docs/StartStopFabric.md)
* [Step 4: Install and Run Art-Ledger on a Local Fabric Network](docs/InstallRunLocalFabric.md)
* [Step 5: Install and Run Art-Ledger on IBM Cloud Starter Plan](docs/InstallRunIBMCloud.md)
